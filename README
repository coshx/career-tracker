== Welcome to Career Tracker

The idea Career Tracker is built around is another concept called the resume database.
While the name implies a database full of resumes, in this case we mean the resume acts
as a database to hold user achievements during their career.  This "database" is then handed
to a potential employer in resume form.

The purpose of this application is to store these achievements emphasizing results.  So, rather
than have a job description, it lists a job title and achievements accomplished during the
user's tenure.  The big idea, here, is to have achievements catagorized and
searchable so a user can generate custom resumes.

By custom resume, we mean the popular concept of having a resume fit the job description.
For example, if a job lists a particular skill, a user could put an achievement on their resume describing
how they not only used that skill, but saved the universe (or at least the company's bottom line) whilst
doing it.

In its present state, our application will store achievements, list them, and allow a user to drag-and-drop
them into a resume template.  Once done, the user can save the resume.
