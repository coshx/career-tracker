== Welcome to Career Tracker

DESCRIPTION:

The idea Career Tracker is built around is another concept called the resume database.
While the name implies a database full of resumes, in this case we mean the resume acts
as a database to hold user achievements during their career.  This "database" is then handed
to a potential employer in resume form.

The purpose of this application is to store these achievements emphasizing results.  So, rather
than have a job description, it lists a job title and achievements accomplished during the
user's tenure.  As a user accomplishes more things during their career, they can enter details
in Career Tracker and have them available when needed.  A major advantage of this application
is users don't have to remember what they did at a job 5 years ago--they can enter details while
they're still fresh.

The big idea, here, is to have achievements categorized and searchable so a user can generate
custom resumes.  Here, we mean the popular concept of having a resume fit the job description.
For example, if a job lists a particular skill, a user could put an achievement on their resume describing
how they not only used that skill, but saved the universe (or at least the company's bottom line) whilst
doing it.

In its present state, our application will store achievements, list them, and allow a user to drag-and-drop
them into a resume template.  Once done, the user can save the resume.
