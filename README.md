##Welcome to Career Tracker

###Using our application:

There are three accounts you can use to login.

logins / passwords are:

  - jed@judge.net / password
  - jerry@judge.net / password
  - carl@judge.net / password

The achievements button allows you to enter achievements if you like, but we've provided
some for you.  Click on Resumes to tailor a resume with your achievements.

###Description:

This application emphasizes career results.  A user can enter career achievements
in Career Tracker and use them for customized resumes.  A major advantage of this application
is users don't have to remember what they did at a job 5 years ago--they can enter details while
they're still fresh and use them in a tailored resume.

Right now, our application stores achievements, lists them, and allows a user to
drag-and-drop them into a resume template.  Once done, the user can save the resume.
